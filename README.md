[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jonhoo/curb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jonhoo/curb)

A command-line tool to restrict a process from using particular hardware
resources. It is particularly geared towards performance-sensitive
multi-core experiments, in which you may want to avoid or measure the
impact of CPU features like [SMT] (e.g., [Intel Hyper-Threading] or
[NUMA memory]. While this is possible with existing tools like
[`hwloc-bind`] and [`numactl`], it's often pretty inconvenient to get
the result you want. With `curb` on the other hand:

```console
$ curb --no-smt --no-numa mycommand
```

Will run `mycommand` _only_ on each physical core on a single NUMA node
(the first one specifically). Note that if you want to pass additional
arguments to the command under test, you can do so using `--`:

```console
$ curb --no-smt mycommand -- --no-crash --performance better
```

To visualize what CPUs are being used using [`lstopo`], do:

```console
$ curb --no-smt --no-numa lstopo -- --pid 0
```

That should show all active cores in green. If you don't have a window
manager running, add `-v` at the end and look for PUs marked with
`(running)`.

## Dependencies

Curb depends on the [`hwloc` crate], which in turn depends on the
[`hwloc` C library].

## OS Support

Curb currently only works on `cfg(unix)` systems, because it sets the
CPU binding [for the current process], and then calls [`exec`]. This
should be possible to work around by instead spawning the process,
getting its identifier, calling [`set_cpubind_for_process`], and then
waiting for the process to exit. However, this has a number of
downsides, like the process _initially_ being unconstrained and having
to proxy things like stdin, stdout, signals, and exit codes. Suggestions
for how to support non-UNIX platforms are warmly welcome!
